# TODO: Sunny Platform Repo Setup and Boilerplate

## Overview
Create a comprehensive GitHub repo structure and boilerplate code for "Sunny": an All-in-One CEX + DeFi platform integrating centralized exchange with DeFi on an EVM-compatible PoS/DPoS blockchain.

## Steps
- [x] Create repo directory structure (smart-contracts/, blockchain-core/, backend/, frontend/, matching-engine/, database/, api-specs/, deployment/, docs/, tests/)
- [x] Smart Contracts: SNY token (ERC-20), AMM DEX (Uniswap-like), Lending protocol (Aave-like), Bridge contract (lock/unlock model) in Solidity with OpenZeppelin, including tests (Hardhat/Truffle)
- [x] Blockchain Core: Basic Go setup with Cosmos SDK for PoS chain, including validator node, genesis, and basic app
- [x] Backend: Node.js/NestJS for REST/WebSocket APIs (markets, orders, payments), Python for ML fraud detection
- [x] Matching Engine: Rust for high-performance orderbook matching, Node.js alternative snippets
- [x] Frontend: React.js/TypeScript boilerplate with Web3Modal for wallet integration, basic UI for trading, lending, wallet
- [x] Database: MongoDB schemas for users, orders, trades, loans; Redis config for caching
- [x] APIs: OpenAPI YAML spec for public/private endpoints, WebSocket for real-time data
- [x] Deployment: Dockerfiles for each service, scripts for Ubuntu local dev (docker-compose), VPS production (Ansible/Terraform)
- [x] Ensure Runnable: Include package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, Cargo.toml, docker-compose.yml
- [x] Tests: Unit tests for contracts, integration for APIs
- [x] Docs: README.md, architecture diagrams, API docs
- [ ] Followup: Install dependencies (npm, yarn, pip, cargo, go), run local tests, deploy to VPS, monitor performance
