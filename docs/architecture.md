# Architecture Overview

## High-Level Architecture
Sunny Platform consists of multiple layers:

1. **Blockchain Layer**: EVM-compatible PoS/DPoS chain for DeFi operations
2. **CEX Layer**: Centralized exchange with high-frequency matching
3. **API Layer**: REST and WebSocket APIs for client interactions
4. **Frontend Layer**: React.js web application
5. **Database Layer**: MongoDB for persistent data, Redis for caching
6. **Security Layer**: HSM, multi-sig, KYC/AML

[Database (MongoDB/Redis)] <-> [Fraud Detection (Python/ML)]
```

## Smart Contracts
- **SNY Token**: ERC-20 governance token
- **AMM DEX**: Uniswap V3-like automated market maker
- **Lending Protocol**: Aave-like lending/borrowing
- **Bridge**: Cross-chain asset transfer

## Backend Services
- **Markets Service**: Real-time market data
- **Orders Service**: Order management and matching
- **Payments Service**: Fiat on-ramp/off-ramp integration
- **Fraud Detection**: ML-based anomaly detection

## Deployment Architecture
- **Local Dev**: Docker Compose with all services
- **Production**: Kubernetes cluster on VPS with load balancers
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling for matching engine, read replicas for DB

## Security Considerations
- End-to-end encryption
- Multi-factor authentication
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Regular security audits
- Compliance with global regulations
